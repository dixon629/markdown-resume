### Profile {#profile}
I have 8 years working experience including almost a year working in Dubai.      
In the last 7 months, as one of the co-founders for the product Track and Remind, I have developed it independently and delivered it on time with good quality in terms of UI/UX, security, and performance etc. The project was built with J2EE and AngularJS, and deployed on AWS.        
Besides, I'm interested in mobile development and new technologies, so I learned to code for iOS and Android, Ruby on Rails. I have successfully developed a few mobile apps independently which was available on App Store and Google Play.
